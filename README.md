### What is this repository for? ###

* This project provide a framework for data preparation, training and testing deep learning models for big spatial data partitioning.
* Version: 0.1
* [Learn Markdown](https://bitbucket.org/tutorials/markdowndemo)

### How to deploy your own models using our framework? ###

* Dataset generators
* Collect data for training and testing
* Train the model
* Use the pre-trained model in your system

### Dataset generators ###
* **Option 1**: We published [a paper](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eldawy/publications/19_SpatialGems.pdf) at [SpatialGems 2019](https://www.spatialgems.net/) about spatial data generators. 
 The generators allow you to create synthetic spatial datasets with your desired distribution and dataset size. 
 The source code is available at [this repository](https://github.com/tinvukhac/spatialdatagenerators).

* **Option 2**: You could use your own spatial datasets to generate training and testing data for next steps.
